# Sitecore.Support.127768
The patch fixes incorrect Shared Layout modifications behavior from the Experience Editor.

## Description
When editing the Shared Layout details in the Experience Editor, the "Renderings" field of an item gets broken. Despite the visual consistency, connection between the Standard Values item of the current item's template and the current item itself gets lost.
